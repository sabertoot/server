# Sabertoot

## Napkin idea

- Cron job polls your Twitter account and stores new tweets in database
- Server displays tweets on your own website and publishes them via the ActivityPub protocol
- You own all your words even if Twitter goes does
- People can follow your tweets from the Fediverse by following your ActivityPub user
- You can have an authentic Fediverse account by running it behind your own domain (e.g.: `@dustin@dusted.codes`)
- Should be easy to host via containers on your own server. Folks and organisations can can "own" their own little micro-blog for their thoughts or official announcements.
- Can be extended in the future to poll from multiple sources (e.g. Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
- Can be extended to build an interface to draft posts primarily here and then publish to other social media accounts

## Sabertoot?

Mastodon is a woolly mammoth, but everyone knows that a saber toothed tiger is the cooler animal. A "toot" is what "tweets" are called on Mastodon. Get it?
